## What is Search?

**Search** is Nuviaâ€™s module for discovering ideal companies and decision-makers using a vast data network, with the option to enrich strategic fields such as buying intent signals. By leveraging intelligent filters, Search enables commercial teams to uncover new opportunities in a precise, scalable, and automated way.

## Objectives

The primary goal of the Search module is to **empower sales and marketing teams** with a robust tool to identify high-potential leads by combining real-time data with AI. It helps to:

- Reduce time spent on manual prospecting and qualification
- Increase the accuracy and quality of the lead database
- Build highly segmented lists using strategic filters
- Improve conversion rates by focusing on accounts with higher closing potential

## How It Works

- Query a global database of companies and decision-makers using precision filters
- Enrich data points such as email, phone, job title, company size, and technologies used
- Discover buying intent signals and real-time events (e.g. job changes, tech adoption, expansion)
- Use AI to generate insights on segments, ideal profiles, and customer similarity
- Export results directly to Worksheets, Records, or your CRM
- View and manage credit usage transparently, with a clear cost per enriched field
