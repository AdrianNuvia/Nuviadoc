## Overview

import SnippetIntro from '/snippets/snippet-intro.mdx';

**Lists** is the module in the Nuvia platform that allows users to **organize and segment their records** in a practical and intelligent way. It enables grouping of contacts or companies into custom lists for organization, prioritization, or activation in campaigns.

  alt="Hero Light"
  title={true}
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-companies-dark.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
/>

The module supports the creation of two types of lists:

- **People Records Lists**
- **Company Records Lists**

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The Lists module aims to give users an additional layer of control and efficiency over their prospect data by allowing them to:

- Organize saved records in a logical and reusable way
- Segment audiences based on strategic criteria (role, industry, region, ICP, etc.)
- Quickly activate outbound campaigns with pre-built audiences
- Reduce manual effort and data duplication
- Improve productivity for sales and marketing teams

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

### ðŸ“Œ Creating a List

- Users can create a new list at any time, selecting whether it will contain **People** or **Companies**.
- Records can be added manually, via **Search**, **Inbound**, or **CSV import**.
- Lists can be renamed, duplicated, deleted, or filtered at any time.

### ðŸ§© Structure

- Each list displays records in a table format, with customized columns depending on the data type (name, title, company, LinkedIn, phone, signals, etc.).
- Supports filters, sorting, bulk actions, and column customization.

### ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Campaigns

- A list can be used directly as a **target audience** for outbound campaigns.
- This reduces the time needed to build campaigns, since contacts are already filtered and grouped.
