## Overview

**Bundles** are prepaid credit packages that users can purchase to supplement their monthly credit plan. Once a bundle is purchased, the credits are immediately added to the account and can be used for actions such as data enrichment and AI-powered tasks.

## Rules and behavior

- **Validity**: 3 months from the date of purchase
- **Availability**: can be purchased regardless of an active plan
- **Consumption order**: bundle credits are consumed **before** monthly plan credits (FIFO: First In, First Out)
- **Limit**: only **1 bundle can be purchased per billing cycle**

## Advantages

- Flexibility for temporary or unexpected demand
- Prevents workflow interruptions
- Better cost-efficiency with larger packages
