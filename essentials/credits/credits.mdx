## Overview

**Credits** are the transactional currency that powers various actions within the Nuvia platform—primarily the enrichment of company and people records. Credits are an essential part of every plan and are **recharged each billing cycle**. They can also be **purchased separately** as needed, either individually (pay-per-use) or through **credit bundles**.

## Fundamentals

To begin using credits, every user must subscribe to a **monthly credit plan**. Plan credits are valid for **one month** and expire at the end of the billing cycle.

- The billing cycle is based on the **subscription date** (e.g., if a user subscribes on May 15, their cycle ends on June 15).
- Each user has their own individual billing cycle.
- Prevents user frustration (e.g., "I subscribed on May 28 and lost credits on June 1").
- Compatible with modern and flexible SaaS platforms.

<Note>
  All **unused credits** at the end of the cycle are **lost and non-refundable**.
</Note>

## Credit usage limits

If a user runs out of credits **before the end of the billing cycle**, they have two options:

### 1. Pay-per-use (Individual consumption)

- If the user has this option **enabled**, each extra credit used will have a determined cost, and the total will be added to their invoice at the end of the cycle.
- If the option is **disabled**, the user can continue using other features of the platform, but won’t be able to enrich data or perform similar actions until the next cycle, unless they **manually purchase a credit bundle**.

### 2. Purchase a credit Bundle

- Once a bundle is purchased, credits are **instantly added** to the account, and enrichment features are reactivated.
- **Bundle credits are valid for 3 months**, offering extended usage time compared to plan credits.
- Bundle credits are always consumed **first**, following the expiration order.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I purchase a bundle and also have pay-per-use credits enabled?" defaultOpen iconType="regular">
    Yes. If you've already purchased a bundle, you can enable pay-per-use without any issues. However, credit consumption follows this priority:\
    **Plan credits → Bundle credits → Pay-per-use credits**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I enable pay-per-use and buy bundles at the same time?" iconType="regular">
    No. Once **pay-per-use** is enabled, **bundle purchases are disabled** to maintain clean, per-action billing logic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the credit consumption order?">
    Credits are debited in the following order:

    1. Bundle credits (by expiration date – FIFO)
    2. Monthly plan credits
    3. Pay-per-use credits (if enabled)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I purchase multiple bundles in the same billing cycle?" iconType="regular">
    No. You may purchase **only one bundle per billing cycle**. For example, you can purchase one between May 15–June 15, and another between June 15–July 15. That’s why we offer a variety of bundle sizes and prices to match different needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does the system choose which bundle to consume first?">
    Bundles are consumed in **FIFO** order (First In, First Out) — the oldest credits are used first to ensure they don’t expire unused.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can bundle credits accumulate over time?">
    Each bundle has an ID and expiration date. For example:

    | ID  | Date of Purchase | Description                           | Billing Cycle   |
    | :-- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------- |
    | B01 | May 20, 2025     | 5,000 credits – expires Aug 18, 2025  | May 15 – Jun 15 |
    | B02 | Jun 22, 2025     | 10,000 credits – expires Sep 22, 2025 | Jun 15 – Jul 15 |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I have leftover bundle credits that aren’t enough for the next action?">
    Bundle logic ensures **100% of your credits can be used**.\
    Example: You have 1 credit left, and an action requires 2 credits. The system will automatically pull the extra credit from your plan (if available).

    | Transaction | Type  | Amount    | Details               |
    | :---------- | :---- | :-------- | :-------------------- |
    | Enrich      | Debit | 2 credits | Bundle: -1 / Plan: -1 |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I run out of credits and don’t have pay-per-use enabled?" iconType="regular">
    You’ll still be able to use the platform normally, but you won’t be able to enrich data or use credit-based actions. Your options:

    - Wait for the next cycle to renew
    - Buy a credit bundle
    - Enable pay-per-use

    The platform will display a clear message indicating no credits are available and guide you through the options.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to unused plan credits at the end of the cycle?" iconType="regular">
    As explained in the Fundamentals section, **plan credits expire at the end of the billing cycle** and do not roll over.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a trial user purchase a bundle?">
    No. Trial accounts receive a limited number of credits for testing purposes only. **Bundle purchases are only available after upgrading to a paid plan**, ensuring a focused trial experience and encouraging conversion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="If I cancel and reactivate my plan in the same cycle, can I buy a new bundle?">
    No. The **one-bundle-per-cycle** rule still applies. Even if you cancel and reactivate during the same billing period, the original bundle limit will remain in effect.
