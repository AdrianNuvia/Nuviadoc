## Overview

**Pay-per-use** is an optional feature that allows users to continue using platform resources even after consuming all credits from their monthly plan or bundles. Each action performed consumes credits at a fixed cost, which will be charged in the next billing cycle.

## Rules and behavior

- **Fixed cost**: R\$0.20 (or equivalent in USD) per credit
- **Billing**: credits used via pay-per-use are added to the monthly invoice
- **Activation**: users can enable or disable this option at any time
- **Compatibility**: When activated, the option to purchase bundles is **disabled** (models are not combinable)

## Advantages

- Continuous usage without service interruptions
- Ideal for users who prefer paying only for what they use
- Clear, usage-based billing with real-time control
