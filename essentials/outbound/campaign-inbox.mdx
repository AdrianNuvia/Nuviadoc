## Objectives

- Centralize the management of responses from LinkedIn campaigns
- Enable continuous communication with leads after campaign delivery
- Integrate automated and human interactions in a single panel

## How does it work?

Once a campaign is launched, all interactions (messages sent, received, and system notifications) are recorded in the tab  **Campaign Inbox**, organized by contact and status.

## Interface Structure

### 1. **Contact list (left panel)**

- Displays leads with recent interactions
- Sorted by most recent activity
- Visual indicators for unread messages
- Shows contact name, company, and connection status

### 2. **Chat area (right panel)**

- Full message history with each lead
- Distinct message blocks for:
  - AI-generated messages
  - Lead responses
  - Manual replies by the user
  - System-generated updates

### 3. **Automation notifications**

System messages inform users about campaign automation events, such as:

üîî Connection Request ‚Äì Connection request sent to [Name]

üì® Follow-up Sent ‚Äì Message step 2 delivered to [Name]

‚ùå Lead Unreachable ‚Äì LinkedIn profile not available
