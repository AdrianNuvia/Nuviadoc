The **Campaigns** module enables users of the Nuvia platform to create, personalize, and manage automated prospecting campaigns. Through integrations with channels like LinkedIn (and soon WhatsApp and email), this module structures the lead outreach journey in a scalable and intelligent way, with AI support for message generation and outreach sequences.

## Objectives

- Automate and scale inbound and outbound campaigns with AI-assisted personalization
- Reduce manual effort in crafting messages and outreach flows
- Ensure consistency and efficiency in lead interactions
- Centralize control and visibility over all ongoing campaigns

## How It Works

Before launching a campaign, the user must go through a **creation and strategic review phase**, which includes defining the audience, objectives, messages, and sequences. No campaign is sent out automatically upon creation.

A campaign is only activated once the user explicitly chooses to **Launch** or **Schedule** it.

## Creating a campaign step-by-step

### 1. Select the type of campaign

At this stage, you can create a **LinkedIn campaign** (with support for WhatsApp and Email coming soon).

To begin, ensure your **LinkedIn account is properly synchronized** with the Nuvia platform.

  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
/>

### 2. Define your target audience

In this step, you’ll select or create a **list of records** (contacts) you wish to target on LinkedIn.

<Warning>
  **Important:** To ensure the automation runs correctly, all records in your campaign must have the **LinkedIn URL field filled out**.

### 3. Set Your Campaign Goals

Here, you can paste an existing **playbook or product description** to guide the campaign messaging.\
If you don’t have one, you can generate content with the help of our AI — just provide the **URL of your website or landing page**, and Nuvia will generate optimized messaging for your campaign.

Next, select the following elements for your first campaign step:

- **Use Case**
- **Framework**
- **Tone of Voice**
- **Length**

These parameters will shape how the AI crafts your message.

  title={true}
/>

### 4. Build and preview your message sequence

You’ll be able to **preview AI-generated messages** for up to 5 contacts from your list.

If a message doesn’t feel quite right, don’t worry — in the next step, you’ll be able to **refine, review, and manually edit each message** in the sequence for every contact.

  alt="Hero Dark"
  title={true}
/>

### 5. Finalize your campaign

After the campaign is created, you’ll see a **full-screen preview** to review all generated messages.\
You can fine-tune them individually or simply click **"Approve All"** to confirm and proceed.

Once approved, your campaign will be **ready to launch or schedule**.

### 6. Launched campaign overview

Once your campaign is launched, it will appear under **"My Campaigns"**, where you’ll see a summary of its key details:

- **Campaign name**
- **Sender account**
- **Target audience**
- **Number of leads**
- **Steps per sequence**
- **Generated messages**
