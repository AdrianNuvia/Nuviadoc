The **Campaigns** module enables users of the Nuvia platform to create, personalize, and manage automated prospecting campaigns. Through integrations with channels like LinkedIn (and soon WhatsApp and email), this module structures the lead outreach journey in a scalable and intelligent way, with AI support for message generation and outreach sequences.

## Objectives

- Automate and scale inbound and outbound campaigns with AI-assisted personalization
- Reduce manual effort in crafting messages and outreach flows
- Ensure consistency and efficiency in lead interactions
- Centralize control and visibility over all ongoing campaigns

## How It Works

Before launching a campaign, the user must go through a **creation and strategic review phase**, which includes defining the audience, objective, messages, and sequences. No campaign is sent out automatically upon creation.

A campaign is only activated once the user explicitly chooses to **Launch** or **Schedule** it.
