## What is records?

**Records** is the Nuvia module that functions as a **System of Action (SoA)** for sales representatives and commercial teams. It centralizes saved records of people and companies — sourced via Search or Inbound — enabling organization, updates, and direct actions on each lead powered by AI.

## 🎯 Objectives

Provide users with a rich and customizable database of people and companies, using structured and adaptable fields that allow:

- Efficient visualization and organization of contacts and accounts
- Use of this data in automation flows and AI-driven insights
- Integration with external data and automatic enrichment
- A customizable CRM experience tailored for sales and SDR teams

## 💡 How it Works

### 1. Overview

An interactive table that displays all saved records of people or companies, with fields like:\
**Name**, **Job Title**, **Company**, **Description**, **LinkedIn**, **Point of Contact**, **Email**, among others.

It supports filters, workspace organization, and selection for bulk editing or export.
