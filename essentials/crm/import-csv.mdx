## Overview

The **Imports** module in the Nuvia platform allows users to upload CSV files containing prospect data (People or Companies) sourced from external CRMs, spreadsheets, or proprietary databases. This functionality is designed to simplify the centralization and organization of data directly within the platform.

## Objectives

- Enable fast and secure import of external data
- Provide a guided and intuitive experience for reviewing, mapping, and validating data
- Ensure compatibility with Nuvia’s data structure
- Facilitate seamless integration with modules such as [**Records**](/essentials/crm/records), [**Lists**](/essentials/data-intelligence/lists), and [**Campaigns**](/essentials/outbound/campaigns)

## How does it work? — Step-by-step import process

### 1. Upload a File

- Users upload a CSV file via drag-and-drop or file selector.
- The platform automatically displays a preview of the detected columns and rows.
- The system identifies the data type (People or Companies).

### 2. Map Columns

- The platform lists the columns found in the CSV file and prompts users to map them to existing fields within the **Records** system.
- Available fields include:

  `Name`, `E-mail`, `Phone`, `Job Title`, `LinkedIn`, `Current Company`\
  `Company`, `Department`, `Seniority`, `Headline`, `Location`, `Twitter`, and others
- Irrelevant columns can be ignored.

### 3. Review

- The system presents a row-by-row preview with mapped columns.
- It highlights:
  - Successfully found values
  - Missing or empty fields
  - Potential formatting errors
- Users can review and correct any issues before finalizing the import.

### 4. Preview Import

- Final display of how the imported data will appear in the platform.
- A table shows all formatted records to be imported.
- Once reviewed, the user confirms the import.

### Key Benefits

- Fast integration of contact lists from CRMs such as **HubSpot**, **Salesforce**, or Excel files
- Intelligent column mapping to reduce manual work
- Data validation before importing
- Full compatibility with the Nuvia ecosystem (**Records**, **Lists**, **Campaigns**)
